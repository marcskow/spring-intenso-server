# Intenso Spring Server

This is my little server for many things. It would be my first "big" server
with REST endpoints, NoSQL database, security and so on. I would like to forward some requests to 
another server just to train, and also apply here as much interesting stuff as I can.

0.0.1 Project initialization, git + gradle + readme.
