# Intenso Spring Server

This is my little server for many things. It would be my first "big" server
with REST endpoints, NoSQL database, security and so on. I would like to forward some requests to 
another server just to train, and also apply here as much interesting stuff as I can.

0.0.1 Project initialization, git + gradle + readme. 

0.1.0 Simple REST controllers for ping and example of CRUD with REST + MongoDB.

0.2.0 Forward REST request to another server to get data.

0.3.0 Authentication. In 0.3 just basic authentication

0.3.1 Authentication. Add rules and fix some problems.

0.3.2 Authentication. HTTPS.

0.3.3 Stateless session, before it I could make some request one by one without authenticate every time. 
Even if these requests needed authentication.

0.3.B.1 Todo refactoring to support items in project

0.4.0 Added tasks controller. 

0.4.1 Tasks controller refactoring, added method for tasks resolving
