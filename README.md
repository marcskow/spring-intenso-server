# Intenso Spring Server

This is my little server for many things. It would be my first "big" server
with REST endpoints, NoSQL database, security and so on. I would like to forward some requests to 
another server just to train, and also apply here as much interesting stuff as I can.

0.0.1 Project initialization, git + gradle + readme. 

0.1.0 Simple REST controllers for ping and example of CRUD with REST + MongoDB.

0.2.0 Forward REST request to another server to get data.

0.3.0 Authentication. In 0.3 just basic authentication
